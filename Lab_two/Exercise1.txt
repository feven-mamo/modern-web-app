QUESTION_ONE: setImmediate() and setTimeout()

setImmediate(): is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes. 
This callbacks are invoked at check phase of the event loop.
setTimeout(): schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed.
The main advantage of using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is setImmediate()
will always be executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle, 
independently of how many timers are present.
 
QUESTION_TWO: setImmediate() and process.nextTick()

process.nextTick() is not part of the event loop.Instead, the nextTickQueue will be processed after the 
current operation completes,regardless of the current phase of the event loop.

*process.nextTick(): fires immediately on the same phase
*setImmediate(): fires on the following iteration or 'tick' of the event loop

It is recommended to use setImmediate() in all cases because it's easier to reason about 
and it leads to code that's compatible with a wider variety of environments.
